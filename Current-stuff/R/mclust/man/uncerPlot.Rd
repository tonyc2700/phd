\title{
  Uncertainty Plot for Model-Based Clustering
}
\description{
  Displays the uncertainty in converting a conditional probablility from EM
  to a classification in model-based clustering.
}
\usage{
uncerPlot(z, truth, \dots)
}
\arguments{
  \item{z}{
    A matrix whose \emph{[i,k]}th entry is the
    conditional probability of the ith observation belonging to
    the \emph{k}th component of the mixture.  
  }
  \item{truth}{
    A numeric or character vector giving the true classification of the data. 
  }
  \item{\dots }{
    Provided to allow lists with elements other than the arguments can
    be passed in indirect or list calls with \code{do.call}.
  }
}
\value{
  A plot of the uncertainty profile of the data,
  with uncertainties in increasing order of magnitude.
  If \code{truth} is supplied and the number of
  classes is the same as the number of columns of 
  \code{z}, the uncertainty
  of the misclassified data is marked by vertical lines on the plot.
}
\details{
  When \code{truth} is provided and the number of classes is compatible
  with \code{z}, the function \code{compareClass} is used to to find best
  correspondence between classes in \code{truth} and \code{z}.

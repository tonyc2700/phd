Background: 

Missing data is a fact of life. Due to a multitude of reasons, ranging from computer errors to human ones, we are left with gaps in our datasets. Regardless of your field of work, from cancer research to paediatricians; it affects you.


Methods:

Using multiple imputation techniques on datasets with missing values, one can create an artificially complete dataset. This works on numerical data such as growth and categorical data such as whether an individuals smokes of not. Once we have such an artificial dataset, how close to the true values is it? Using cluster validation techniques we can answer such a question. A further verification of the results can be obtained by cross referencing regression coefficients from the datasets to each other. 


Results:

Due to data linkage approvals and other ethical approvals, I am yet to receive the real datasets to test the ideas. Shortly they should be approved. Our hypothesis is, of course, that these methods will indicate how realistic and reliable our new artificially complete datasets are. 


Conclusions:

This framework will indicate good an artificially complete dataset is when created from an incomplete one. Thus giving us a confidence level, whether good or bad, when conduction research on such dataset. Regardless of your field of work, this affects you.
